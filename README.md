### Welcome to Tetriso Project.
Tetriso is JavaScript Tetris with minor game design improvements. It is developed as semestral project at CTU in Prague on course (KAJ - Client Applications in JavaScript).  It's now in early development phase, it should be finished until July of 2014. I hope you will enjoy this little JavaScript game and if you would like to contribute, I will be more than happy to hear from you.
